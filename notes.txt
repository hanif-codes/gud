Steps to manually get Gud working:
- Add the directory containing the shell script (src/gud) to PATH ---> export PATH=$PATH:/home/hanif/gud/src
    - This allows "gud" to work as a command, that will run the gud script as if you did ./gud




Ideas:
- Have an in-built means to locate all/local other gud repositories. In the event that a user is
in the wrong directory when trying to use gud commands.
    - Something like: "You are not in a Gud directory. Maybe you thought you were in <file_path_to_nearest_gud_dir>?"


gud init
- use "questionary" (https://pypi.org/project/questionary/) for the interactive selection screen(s)



Useful notes:
- `with open()...` will open a file relative to the working directory where the initial script was invoked
    - NOT necessarily the directory where the (imported) module lies
