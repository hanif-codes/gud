### Installation Instructions

1. Download and install Python 3.10 or above, from https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Open your `Terminal`
3. Confirm that `python` and `pip` are installed on your machine:
    - `python --version` (or `python3 --version`)
    - `pip --version` (or `pip3 --version`)
    - Ensure that neither of the above commands returns an error
4. Make sure you are not in a virtual environment in your terminal (you likely are not, but type in `deactivate` just to make sure), then run the command:
    - `pip install "git+https://github.com/finahdinner/gud.git`
5. Close your terminal and open it in your project directory
