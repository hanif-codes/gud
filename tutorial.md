### Gud Tutorial (5-10 minutes)

#### Before you begin, please make sure to follow the installation instructions [here](README.md).<br>Once Gud is up an running (use `gud hello` to test this), you may begin!

Quick notes before starting:

- All commands in this tutorial `look like this`.
- To use a command in the terminal, type it in (exactly as shown), then press enter.
- If you at any point get stuck or lost, feel free to start from the beginning. To do this, do the following:
  - Use the command `cd ..` (this takes you back out of the tutorial folder)
  - Delete the _gud_tutorial_ folder
  - Then start the tutorial from the beginning

### Gud Tutorial

#### Gud is a basic [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) which, similar to [Git](https://git-scm.com/), offers an array of commands and functionality for keeping track of a part of your file system.

#### It is normally used to help people develop software, and is especially useful if you want to be able to revert changes, work on different features, or collaborate with others.

#### In this tutorial, we will be using a very simple example folder to demonstrate how _Gud_ works. Having some prior experience with using Git through the command line is _helpful_, although not necessary.

1. To begin, open up an empty folder in a text editor of your choice (for example, _VSCode_ or _Pycharm_).
2. Open up an integerated **terminal** window inside your text editor. It will normally be at the bottom of your screen.
3. Use the command `gud loadexample`
   - This will load a folder with example files in it
4. Use the command `cd loadexample`
   - This will navigate your terminal to the "loadexample" folder
5. Take a moment to look at all the files in this folder. There are only a few, and they each only contain a single line of text. Nothing too exciting!
