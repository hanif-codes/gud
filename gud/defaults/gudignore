# If you wish to tell Gud not to track any specific files or directories, specify these files
# or directories in this file, with one pattern per line.
# example: if you don't want Gud to track your virtual environment, you might write venv/ on a line
# example: if you don't want Gud to track any files beginning "f", you might write f* on a line
# see https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore/en for supported patterns
