# If you wish to tell Gud not to track any specific files or directories, specify these files
# or directories in this file, with one path per line.
# example: if you don't want Gud to track a file called notes.txt, you would write notes.txt on a line
# example: if you don't want Gud to track a virtual environment called venv/, you would write venv/ on a line
